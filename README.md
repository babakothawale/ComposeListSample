# ComposeListSample
Create List in Compose

Compose has deep learning curve. Thinking in Compose can be little bit difficult for the developers who not yet started with Compose and coding in exiting View based apps.</br>
Because first thing comes in mind, how to do 'this' thing in 'compose' as I do like 'this', I have started with List.</br>
Offcource, there are bunch of tutorial, video, codelab, pathways on Andorid developer docs to start with.

Here in this example, I have maintained incremental branches names from 01, 02,.. as I go further learning the compose...
like 01BasicList, 02BasicList_ItemClick,..

Hope this will be useful for someone!
